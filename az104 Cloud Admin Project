This is a project I am working on from scratch, with the outline designed by a.i.,
to focus my skills on everything that is within the az-104 Azure Cloud Administrator Certification.
Primarily for more hands-on, and to showcase my proficiency and scalable skillset on my journey 
into the azure | cloud | network/sysadmin realm.


Here's a structured project idea (I got using chatgpt) that reflects these skills:

Project: Deploy and Manage a Scalable Web Application on Azure

1. Setting up the Environment
-Create a Resource Group: Organize your resources by creating a resource group.
-Configure Azure Active Directory (i use microsoft entra ID instead for this project):
Set up users and groups.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.

2. Implementing and Managing Storage
-Create Storage Accounts: Set up Azure Storage accounts for the application.
-Configure Blob Storage: Use Blob Storage for storing unstructured data like images or files.
Implement Azure File Shares: Set up file shares that can be mounted on VMs.

3. Deploying and Managing Azure Compute Resources
-Create Virtual Machines (VMs): Deploy VMs to host the web application.
-Configure VM sizes based on application requirements.
Implement VM extensions for automatic configuration and management.
Set up Azure App Services: Deploy the web application using Azure App Services for a scalable and managed hosting environment.
Implement Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Ensure high availability and scalability for the application by setting up VM scale sets.

4. Configuring and Managing Virtual Networking
-Create a Virtual Network (VNet): Set up a VNet to manage networking in Azure.
-Configure subnets and network security groups (NSGs).
Set up a VPN gateway for secure connections.
Configure Load Balancer: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple VMs using an Azure Load Balancer.
Implement Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups: Secure the network with appropriate firewall rules or NSGs.

5. Monitoring and Backing Up Azure Resources
-Implement Azure Monitor: Set up monitoring for the application, VMs, and other resources.
-Configure alerts and notifications for critical events.
Use Log Analytics to collect and analyze log data.
Set up Azure Backup: Implement backup solutions for VMs, databases, and other critical data.
Configure Azure Site Recovery: Ensure business continuity by setting up disaster recovery plans.

6. Additional Services and Features
-Implement Azure Key Vault: Manage and store keys, secrets, and certificates securely.
Set up Azure SQL Database: Deploy and manage a scalable SQL database for the application.
Integrate Azure CDN: Improve performance and scalability by integrating a Content Delivery Network.

7. Documentation and Presentation
-Document the Project: Create comprehensive documentation for each step, including configurations, commands used, and screenshots.
-Prepare a Presentation: Summarize the project goals, architecture, implementation steps, and outcomes. Include a live demo if possible.
Tools and Technologies
-Azure Portal
-Azure CLI , (bash is my preference)
PowerShell
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
-Terraform (optional)
Deliverables
Documentation: Detailed project documentation.
Source Code: Scripts and templates used for deployment and configuration.
Presentation: Slides summarizing the project.
completing this project, covers the core skills required for an Azure Cloud Administrator , and demonstrate your ability to design, deploy, and manage a complex Azure environment.
