# Azure Cloud Infrastructure Project

A comprehensive Azure cloud deployment project demonstrating core Azure Administrator skills including resource management, networking, security, and disaster recovery implementation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project showcases practical application of Azure Cloud Administrator (AZ-104) competencies by designing, deploying, and managing a scalable web application infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. Built entirely from scratch to demonstrate hands-on cloud administration expertise.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Resource Group Management**: Centralized resource organization and lifecycle management
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**: 
  - User and group provisioning
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
  - Identity and access management

### 2. Storage Solutions
- **Azure Storage Accounts**: Configured for application data persistence
- **Blob Storage**: Unstructured data management (images, files, media)
- **Azure File Shares**: Shared file system accessible across multiple VMs

### 3. Compute Resources
- **Virtual Machines**: 
  - Custom VM deployment and configuration
  - Right-sized instances based on workload requirements
  - VM extensions for automated management
- **Azure App Services**: Managed web application hosting with built-in scaling
- **Virtual Machine Scale Sets**: Auto-scaling infrastructure for high availability

### 4. Networking Infrastructure
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: 
  - Custom subnet configuration
  - Network Security Groups (NSGs) for traffic control
  - VPN Gateway for secure hybrid connectivity
- **Azure Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution across multiple instances
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and NSG policies for defense-in-depth

### 5. Monitoring & Disaster Recovery
- **Azure Monitor**: 
  - Real-time resource monitoring
  - Custom alerts and notifications
  - Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
- **Azure Backup**: Automated backup solutions for VMs and databases
- **Azure Site Recovery**: Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) implementation

### 6. Security & Database Services
- **Azure Key Vault**: Centralized secrets, keys, and certificate management
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database with automatic scaling
- **Azure CDN**: Content delivery network for improved global performance

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Cloud Platform:**  
Microsoft Azure

**Management Tools:**  
Azure Portal | Azure CLI | PowerShell | Bash scripting

**Infrastructure as Code:**

## 📋 Project Methodology

1. Manual infrastructure deployment through Azure Portal
2. Script-based automation using Azure CLI and PowerShell
3. ARM template development for repeatable deployments
4. Comprehensive documentation of configurations and commands
5. Security hardening and compliance validation

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

- Azure resource lifecycle management
- Virtual networking and hybrid connectivity
- Identity and access management with Entra ID
- Storage architecture design and implementation
- High availability and disaster recovery planning
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- Security best practices and compliance

## 📝 Documentation

All configurations, deployment scripts, and architectural decisions were documented throughout the build process, including:
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Azure CLI/PowerShell commands
- Network diagrams and architecture screenshots
