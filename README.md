    👋 Hi, I’m Christopher🍋📈😁

    👀 I've always had an interest in technology and computers, however,
    I started my journey into the tech world back in 2022,
    where I began my studies in front end web development and got my Responsive Web Design Certification
    from freecodecamp (html, css, js). 
    As time moved on, I realized that front end web design was growing more likely to 
    be replaced by A.I. in the future. That initial certification gave me a fundamental 
    understanding of coding, but I wanted to pursue other skillsets and identify what else I enjoyed
    in the tech space. 

    🌱Fast forward to 2024, Where my focus shifted to cloud tech.
    I worked to build my experience and skillset in cloud technologies(Azure) along with
    systems and network administration. I acquired my Az-900 Azure Fundamentals
    certification, and have completed the course and created projects to prepare myself for the AZ-104 certification.
    along with this I gained knowledge of working with VMs, RPCs and nodes from my personal interest in the crypto space and web3.
    Taught myself the fundamentals of working in the terminal with Linux & powershell, programming with python and backend skills like API's and learned more about implementing 
    them (what I could without paying subscriptions) and leveraging LLM's to build and code trading bots and adjust their settings in a terminal style UI. 

    Now, Fall 2025, I have enrolled in school full time to pursue a computer science degree and put myself in a fast paced, structured learning environment to further scale my knowledge and skills
    as I have a few [Redacted] mid --> long term goals that I am pursuing in this space. I love tech and this is more than just about job placement for me. I am working to build a lifestyle that I love
    and consistently master myself and my intelligence in a futureproof way. 
    
    I'd love to collaborate on any project that I can learn from and also provide value to a team in the process of my journey in the tech space!
