    👋 Hi, I’m Christopher🍋📈😁

    👀 I originally started my journey into the tech world back in 2022,
    where I began my studies in front end web development skills (html, css, js) 
    before later realizing that FEWD in particular was more likely to 
    be replaced by A.I. in the future. Though it gave me a fundamental 
    understanding of coding, I wanted to pursue other career paths in the tech space
    while continuing to live a lifestyle that I am passionate about!

    🌱Fast forward to 2024, Where my focus has shifted to cloud tech.
    I Have been working to build my experience and skillset in cloud technologies(Azure) along with
    systems and network administration. So far I have acquired my Az-900 Azure Fundamentals
    certification, and have completed the course and created projects in preparation to schedule 
    my Az-104 Azure Administrator certification in Q4 2024. I also have been acquiring a fundamental 
    understanding in Linux(fedora, ubuntu), scripting (bash), SQL, terraform, and I wish to acquire my RHCSA
    next, after finishing my az104 certification successfully. 

    I’m always looking to collaborate on any project that I can learn from and also provide value 
    to the team in the process of my journey into cloud tech! 

    (The credentials on my desired current roadmap: Linux(RHCSA), Azure(az104), 
    A+, Net+, CCNA, Terraform, Docker, AWS and more) email me @Lmnz.92x@gmail.com
