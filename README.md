    👋 Hi, I’m Christopher🍋📈😁

    👀 I originally started my journey into the tech world back in 2022,
    where I began with an interest front end web development skills (html, css, js) 
    before later realizing that front end web development in particular has a bigger 
    chance of being replaced by A.I. in the future. Though it gave me a decent coding
    foundation, I wanted to pursue other career paths in the tech space, while 
    continuing to live a lifestyle that I am passionate about!

    🌱Fast forward to 2024, Where I have been shifting my focus to cloud tech,
    and Have been working to build and scale my skillset in cloud technologies,
    (specifically Azure) where I have acquired Certifications in Az-900 Azure Fundamentals 
    and Az-104 Azure Administrator. Along with gaining my Azure credentials I have been learning 
    Linux and bash scripting, while i shift my focus to acquire more skills.

    I’m always looking to collaborate on any project or task that I could learn from,
    and provide value while learning as well! Cheers to new knowledge, and growth along the path!
