# Hi, I'm Christopher 👋

Aspiring cloud and cybersecurity professional with a passion for building secure, scalable infrastructure and exploring emerging technologies.

## 🚀 My Journey

I started my tech journey in 2022 with front-end web development, earning my **Responsive Web Design Certification** from freeCodeCamp (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). While this gave me foundational coding skills, I discovered my true interest lay deeper in infrastructure, security, and backend systems.

By 2024, I pivoted to **cloud technologies and network security**, working hands-on with Azure infrastructure, virtual machines, and Linux systems administration. Through personal projects in the crypto/Web3 space, I gained practical experience with VMs, RPCs, nodes, and terminal-based workflows.

**Current Focus (2026):**  
Pursuing a **Computer Science degree** full-time while actively building my skills in:
- Penetration testing and ethical hacking
- Cloud infrastructure (Azure certified)
- Network security and Linux administration
- Python automation and backend development

## 🎓 Certifications & Education

- **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** - Certified
- **Computer Science/Computer Engineering** - Currently enrolled
- **Responsive Web Design** - freeCodeCamp
